# Car Project

## Project Introduction: 

**Project Tutor:** Fazl Ullah Khan 
**Duration:** June 19, 2024 - September 2024

**Brief introduction:** This project addresses the issues of frequent lane changes, sudden braking, and potential fatigue driving by online-hired drivers. The aim is to design an app to detect and evaluate driver behavior. The project is divided into two branches:

**A.** After collecting data through both software and hardware, the data is processed using Machine Learning (ML) to detect whether the driver is making sudden lane changes or braking.      

Software: By developing simple-function apps for both Android and iOS or a webview (suggested by student Anzhi Xu, to be discussed with the professor in the group meeting), we will utilize the built-in sensors of mobile phones to collect data.

Hardware: We will seek more suitable sensors to detect issues related to sudden lane changes and braking by drivers.

**B.** Detect whether the driver is fatigued by observing the driver's facial features, eye signals, and head movements. This branch involves Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the feasibility and implementation methods (i.e., innovative points) will be discussed in the group meeting.
